					h4.position Front End Devloper and Technical Systems Analyst
					h4.timeline September 2017 - August 2018
					.desc At RBC I worked as a frontend developer for 8 months followed by 4 months of working as a technical systems analyst. </br></br> As a frontend developer, I was entrusted with creating the frontend assets ensuring that they upheld the companyâ€™s standard of excellence. I also ensured that the content on the web pages worked well with screen readers and fullfilled the rigorous accessibility requirements set by the company. </br></br> As a technical systems analyst I helped devise a method to inject mock JSON data into HTML templates for mid-tier developers to work with. This removed the reliance on DevOps to have working APIs completed in time for mid-tier to work with.
